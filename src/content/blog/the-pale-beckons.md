No tracking. No likes. No suggestion engine humming in the background, calculating what you should want next.

This site won't recommend anything because it has nothing to sell. It is not optimizing for <span class="glitch-word">engagement</span>. It exists in the quiet margins of the net that half-forgotten place where people wrote things down for no one in particular. It doesn’t whisper, *“You might also like…”* — because it does not <span class="glitch-word--red">care</span> if you do.

There's value in that.

There is no comment section. Not because dialogue is unwelcome — but because not all thoughts are requests for feedback. Some are better left standing alone, quiet and <span class="glitch-word">flickering</span> in a monitor.

This site is a static artifact. It loads quickly. It forgets you. It doesn't count your visit. And when you leave, it won’t try to bring you back.

That’s the point.
