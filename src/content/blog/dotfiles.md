No plugin manager can save you from the void. No splash screen will replace the hum of real understanding.

But a keypress — *a real one* — that you <span class="glitch-word">mapped yourself</span>?

That’s something.

People think dotfiles are just configs. They’re not. They’re <span class="glitch-word--red">ritual</span>. They’re defiance. A rejection of bloat, of noise, of the countless things that assume control the second you look away.  

Writing your own dotfiles is writing your own <span class="glitch-word">gravity</span>.

You decide how the terminal breathes. How `nvim` unfolds. How silence is preserved between your fingers and the screen. Each `alias`, each remap, each `.sh` script a votive offering to the self you’re trying to become — one keystroke at a time.

There’s no mouse here. No dark pattern UI. No animation begging you to click. Just a black void, <span class="glitch-word--red">blinking</span>, waiting for command.

You hit `<leader>ff`. You find your files.

You build <span class="glitch-word">muscle memory</span> instead of forgetting menus.

And the mechanical key switches — tactile browns, thocks and clacks — they remind you that the body is still here. That the real world hasn’t been completely smoothed over by touchscreens. That **syntax** is a kind of <span class="glitch-word">music</span>.

Neovim isn’t <span class="glitch-word">“productivity.”</span>  
Dotfiles aren’t <span class="glitch-word--red">“workflow.”</span>  
They're **place**.  
A handmade place. 

Each `.lua` file, each `install.sh`, each `Makefile` and `defaults.sh` is a spell. You’re not just configuring an editor. You’re constructing the future memory of what it felt like to <span class="glitch-word">care</span>.

No telemetry. No onboarding wizard.  
Just: `./install`

And then it’s yours.

No one is watching.  
No one is tracking how often you type `:w`.  
There is no plugin to remind you to hydrate.

This is the point.

Make it weird. Make it yours.  
Make it so when you press that first key, it feels like a door sliding open in the dark.

The terminal doesn’t want to help you.  
It wants you to **wake up**. <span class="terminal-cursor"></span>
